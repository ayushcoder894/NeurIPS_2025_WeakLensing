NeurIPS 2025 Weak Lensing Challenge
=====================================

INTRODUCTION
------------
This competition focuses on analyzing weak gravitational lensing data to infer cosmological parameters.
Weak lensing refers to subtle distortions in galaxy shapes caused by light deflection through the universe's
matter distribution, providing a powerful probe of dark matter and cosmological models.

COMPETITION TASKS
-----------------
The competition is structured in two phases, focusing on two key cosmological parameters:
- Ω_m: Fraction of matter energy density in the universe
- S_8: Amplitude of matter fluctuations in the present-day universe

Phase 1: Cosmological Parameter Estimation
- Develop models to infer Ω_m and S_8 from weak lensing observations
- Predict point estimates (Ω̂_m, Ŝ_8) and uncertainties (σ̂_Ω_m, σ̂_S_8)
- Account for simulation-model mismatch and distribution shift
- Handle systematic effects and observational uncertainties

DATASET DESCRIPTION
-------------------
Data Source: Simulated datasets mimicking Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey observations
Image Dimensions: 1424 × 176 pixels
Resolution: 2 arcmin per pixel
Field: Convergence map of redshift BIN 2 of WIDE12H subfield in HSC Y3

Data Generation:
- 101 different spatially-flat ΛCDM cosmological models
- High-resolution cosmological ray-tracing simulations
- Each model varies in Ω_m and S_8 parameters
- Includes realistic systematic effects:
  * Baryonic effects
  * Photometric redshift uncertainty
  
Training Dataset: ~26,000 labeled samples
Labels: (Ω_m, S_8) for each convergence map

Systematic Parameters:
- Nuisance parameters that need to be marginalized during inference
- Fully sampled in training set for marginalization

BASELINE METHODS
----------------

1. Power Spectrum Analysis
   - Uses power spectrum P(k) as summary statistic
   - Summary: d = log P(k)
   - Traditional cosmological analysis approach
   - Captures limited information compared to ML methods

2. Convolutional Neural Network + MCMC
   - CNN predicts point estimates: θ = (Ω̂_m, Ŝ_8)
   - Summary: d = f_NN^ϕ with n_d = 2
   - Trained with MSE loss
   - Uses MCMC for uncertainty quantification

3. Convolutional Neural Network Direct Prediction
   - CNN directly predicts parameters and uncertainties
   - Outputs: (Ω̂_m, Ŝ_8, σ̂_Ω_m, σ̂_S_8)
   - Trained with KL divergence loss:
     KL Loss = (1/N) Σ {(Ω̂_m,i - Ω_m,i^truth)²/σ̂²_Ω_m,i + 
                        (Ŝ_8,i - S_8,i^truth)²/σ̂²_S_8,i + 
                        log(σ̂²_Ω_m,i) + log(σ̂²_S_8,i)}
   - No explicit MCMC sampling required
   - Assumes joint Gaussian posterior distribution

Performance:
- Neural network methods capture more information than traditional power spectrum analysis
- Lead to better cosmological parameter predictions
- More effective at extracting non-Gaussian features from cosmic web

KEY CHALLENGES
--------------
1. Simulation-model mismatch: Simulations may not accurately represent real observations
2. Observational systematics: Need robust methods that handle systematic uncertainties
3. Non-Gaussian features: Traditional two-point statistics are insufficient
4. Uncertainty quantification: Must provide reliable confidence estimates
5. Generalization: Methods should work across different cosmological models

COMPETITION GOALS
-----------------
1. Quantify information content extractable by different analysis methods
2. Compare classical statistics vs. ML-based approaches
3. Evaluate robustness to simulation inaccuracies and systematics
4. Guide development of next-generation weak lensing analysis pipelines
5. Foster collaboration between astrophysics and machine learning communities
6. Improve cosmological inference for surveys: LSST, Euclid, Roman Space Telescope
